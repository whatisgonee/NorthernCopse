			<span style="font-size:18px;font-family:'Mukta', sans-serif;">It's long past dusk and the nearest settlement is miles away. But what's that? A town of sorts? Hidden in the woods, blinking lights of a hundred curious eyes. Staring as you pass by. A glimpse of a long forgotten memory. Just a quick moment and it will fade away just like the town itself. Protected by the woods. Welcome to Northern Copse.<br><br>Our eyes are all fixated on one point of our vision. You. A stranger, a visitor, a tourist? We have not seen anybody arrive in our town in a long time. But the news shall not wait, a single person who arrives in our enclosed community is not enough to get on the front page of the newspaper. There are much more interesting things happening around our little town than you. So sit down and listen as we speak into your eyes.<br>With spring shortly to arrive and offer us some warmth, citizens are advised to wear boots and coats to protect themselves from the still ruling winter. So pop that hat on and tie up that scarf around your neck before you exit your cosy house. And be careful, since today our town is covered in strange, warm and seemingly living tubes of meat. We do not know where they are coming from. We do not know how they appeared here. But be careful, they are very easy to trip over.<br>The Society of Curious Eyes reports that no anomalies have been detected in the past and future two weeks, meaning that the long and floppy tubes of meat that stretch around the entire neighbourhood are of natural origin. We are not quite sure whether to calm down or panic. I certainly liked them more when I thought about them as a new method to bring central heating to my house. We will keep you updated on the issue. Hopefully.<br>In other news, police are still looking for Johnson Rigby, who has been missing for over a week now. Currently, police officers and volunteers are conducting a search party around the local woods and disturbingly, clothes of Mr. Rigby have been found a few miles away from the edge of town. It is unknown whether he is alive or not, however, with these temperatures the doctors doubt that he will last long if he is, in fact, alive. If you hold any information on the location of Mr. Rigby, please inform the local police station or write us a letter. Thank you.<br>It seems that these tubes of meat and heat have started to move. They are slowly covering houses and streets, getting into cafes and even our editorial department of the newspaper agency. But on the bright side, we have finally understood what these things are. They are human hands. Very, very long human hands. With regular fingers and palms that seem to be not moving and very long arms. The Society of Curious Eyes decided to follow the trail of hands and hopefully find the source and origin of them. For now, just be careful as you walk to work or home, as these hands seem to be getting more intelligent and might pickpocket, if not rob you.<br>And now, a word from our sponsors, without whom we would simply cease to exist. Thank you for keeping our existence.<br>"Have you lost your cat? It's a real tragedy when you lose your favourite pet. Even a goldfish. A parrot. A rat. Some people say that rats aren't supposed to be kept as pets, but that's just a lie. If you're a rat owner, don't listen to them. Don't listen to anybody. Simply listen to your rat. The rat is the only true friend. It will never lie. It will never interrupt. It will never betray. Unlike those humans who secretly spy on you. Who do they think they are to commit such privacy crimes? The government? But the rat will do no harm to you. It's a mutual friendship, even though your rat never speaks to you. Except it does, you just have to listen closely. More closely. Even more closely. Stop listening to yourself. The rat is now your only voice."<br>This has been the word from our sponsors.<br>We have good news and bad news. The good news is: the source of the long arms has been found. The bad news is: Mr. Rigby is dead. Well, not dead in a usual sense. By sheer luck, the search party for Mr. Rigby and the Society of Curious Eyes had found what they were looking for at the same time. Here's the story of how Mr. Rigby died (except he didn't) and why we have long arms on our streets.<br>If you're close friends with the Rigby family, you may know that Mr. Rigby suffered from dementia. He often used to forget many things, from where the car keys were (even though he didn't have a car) to how he got home. Last Friday was not an exception. Forgetting his way home, Mr. Rigby stumbled his way to the edge of town and through the forest. By 11 pm, Mrs. Rigby reported her husband missing to the local police who immediately filed the case and started the search. At around 12 pm, Mr. Rigby found himself miles away from the town in a valley near the mountains. After an hour or so of futile attempts to find his way back, Mr. Rigby found a cavern on the mountain side and for some reason decided to explore. There, he found a, most likely, human skeleton wearing a helmet and holding a bottle of unspecified liquid. After his findings, Mr. Rigby, trying to quench his thirst, drank the entire bottle without a second thought. A few minutes later, Mr. Rigby died. Except, he didn't, as he transformed himself into a ball of flesh covered in extremely long, serpentine hands. Unable to speak and probably baffled, Mr. Rigby continued his search for his house. It took him the whole week, but last night, at around 2 am, the long hands of Mr. Rigby finally found our town and consequently his house, giving Mrs. Rigby a fright of her life.<br>To all of our worried readers, Mr. Rigby has been hospitalised after police and the Society of Curious Eyes found him in a cavern. Currently, the medical team of Northern Copse is trying to find a way to transform Mr. Rigby to his original or at the very least to a human-looking form. The cavern in which the skeleton that Mr. Rigby found has been closed for an investigation by the police to prevent any more accidental transformations. If you or your relative have been accidentally transformed into a ball of flesh covered in limbs, please immediately report to the police your or your relative's location as well as any details on how exactly this happened.<br>And finally, donâ€™t forget to boil your tea for the spirit that lives in your house. Goodnight.<br></span>
